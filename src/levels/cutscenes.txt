Welcome to the story of our brave explorer, utilizing logic to find the treasures of the lost space colony
To navigate through the elaborate lair, you must utilize the information available to you and select the correct levers to proceed
It seems that the various symbols and gates relate to different functions, suggesting that learning the codes could fast track your journey to riches
As you progress farther into the lair, your signal from the outside world diminishes, meaning you must become more reliant on your own intuition
It seems the lair was abandoned before all the rooms were finished, perhaps you could find a way though despite this?
