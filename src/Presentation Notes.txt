Presentation Notes

Target age group -- Middle to high school kids interested in programming

Goal -- To introduce the basic concepts of boolean logic, the basis of many topics in computing

Key Features -- Learn by trial, learn types of logic gates, reading basic circuit diagrams, dependent and independent variables, creative solutions, entertaining puzzle game.

Many games connect turning on and off levers with progressing, but far far fewer make an effort to translate this mechanic into the logic that is behind it, which we think can be used to familiarize learners with the basic concepts of programming and circuits.  Our game presents progressively harder puzzles, the first of which are used to teach the gates basic usage, while the later puzzles are very difficult to solve without studying the circuit diagrams.  This creates a motivation for the player to open the terminals and look at the diagrams, instead of simply trying all possible combinations to find the correct solution.
